# Aynchronous Functions

Asynchronous functions are queued up and run at some point in the future. Great for expensive
or bulk operations.

## Writing Async Functions

When writing functions, the only differences between an async function and a sync function are:

1. There is no immediate response, output goes to the logs instead.
1. The response when calling a function returns a JSON object containing the `call_id`.

Response:

```json
{"call_id":"01BVJ2NZ1N07WGA00000000000"}
```

You can then use this `call_id` to retrieve information later.

## Create a Function

Let's create a function and make it async:

![user input](../images/userinput.png)
>```sh
>fn init --runtime go asyncfn
>cd asyncfn
```

Now open `func.yaml` and add `type: async`, for example:

![user input](../images/userinput.png)
>```yaml
>name: asyncfn
>type: async
>version: 0.0.1
>runtime: go
>entrypoint: ./func
```

Now let's deploy it:

![user input](../images/userinput.png)
>```sh
>fn deploy --local --app myapp
>```

Now we've deployed it as an async function so when we call it, it will be queued up to run later.

And call the asyncfn function:

![user input](../images/userinput.png)
>```sh
>fn call myapp /asyncfn
>```

Now you'll get a response like:

```json
{"call_id":"01BVJ5T7CA07WGE00000000000"}
```

## Check Status and Get Logs

We can retrieve the function call status by checking the status endpoint in the API.

Using the CLI, try running the following, replacing `CALL_ID` with the `call_id` returned above.

![user input](../images/userinput.png)
>```sh
>fn calls get myapp CALL_ID
>```

You'll get something like the following:

```
ID: 01BVJ5T7CA07WGE00000000000
App: myapp
Route: /asyncfn
Created At: 2017-10-03T22:31:01.258Z
Started At: 2017-10-03T22:31:01.908Z
Completed At: 2017-10-03T22:31:02.615Z
Status: success
```

We can see that the Status is `success` which means the call finished properly. And you can see the time it started and completed.

But how do we check the logs to debug and ensure things ran properly? There's a `log` endpoint to allow you to check this and you can 
access it via the CLI with:

![user input](../images/userinput.png)
>```sh
>fn logs get myapp CALL_ID
>```

For this function, the logs will contain:

```json
{"message":"Hello World"}
```

## Wrapping Up

Congratulations! In this tutorial you learned how to create and setup an async function. It's not much different
than a synchronous function as you learned, but it's a powerful difference for expensive, long running or batch operations.
