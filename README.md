# Tutorials

Each of the tutorials below provides a step by step examination and walkthrough of a specific Fn feature or component.  Check back soon as new tutorials are being added regularly.

## Introduction to Fn

[Install Fn and deploy your first functions.](Introduction/README.md)

## Applications

[Learn how to group your functions into an application/API and deploy them together.](Apps/README.md) 

## Testing Functions

Fn has an easy way to write tests for any language, that can ensure you don't break your function contract.

[Learn how to write function tests](Testing/README.md)

## Asynchronous Functions

[Learn how to write asynchronous functions for expensive, long running or batch processing.](Async/README.md)

## Containers as Functions

[This tutorial provides a simple example of how to
define an Fn function using a custom built Docker containeer.](ContainerAsFunction/README.md)

## Developing Java Functions

[Use the Java FDK to write functions and unit test them with the JUnit test harness.](JavaFDKIntroduction//README.md)

## Troubleshooting Fn

Sometimes things aren't working just how you'd like them and you'd like to figure out what's going on.  This tutorial focuses on [troubleshooting techniques](Troubleshooting/README.md) you can use to resolve issues at both development and deployment time.

## Introducing Flow

Get started with Flow with 

* [Flow 101](Flow101/README.md)
* [Flow 102](Flow102/README.md)

## Fn Flow Saga Pattern

Fn Flow provides a way to orchestrate functions to build sophisticated applications--initially using Java and soon with other programming languages.  [In this tutorial you will learn how to use Fn Flow to implement a Java travel booking system that leverages functions written in a variety of languages.](FlowSaga/README.md)

## Fn metrics in Grafana and Prometheus

[Learn how to view Fn server metrics with Grafana and Prometheus](grafana/README.md)
