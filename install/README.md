# Install Fn

Fn is a lightweight Docker-based serverless functions platform you can
run on your laptop, server, or cloud.  In this installation tutorial
we'll walk through installing Fn.

Setting up a working Fn installation involves these three simple steps:
* Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites
* Download the Fn command line interface (CLI) utility
* Run `fn start` command which will download the Fn server docker image and start the Fn server

## Before you Begin

Before we can install Fn you'll need:

1. A computer running Linux or MacOS.  If you have a Windows machine the
easiest thing to do is install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
and run a free Linux virtual machine.
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 17.10 (or higher) needs to be
installed and running.
    * **Note:** Version 0.6.12+ of the Fn CLI added Podman support. To use Podman to build Fn images, see: [Using Fn with Podman instead of Docker](https://github.com/fnproject/docs/blob/master/fn/develop/podman.md)

perform an action.

## Download and Install the Fn CLI
For a MacOS installation you can use Homebrew:

>```sh
> brew update && brew install fn
> ```

Or, alternatively for Linux/Unix/MacOS from a terminal type the following:

![](images/userinput.png)
>```sh
> curl -LSs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fnproject/cli/master/install | sh
>```

Once installed you'll see the Fn CLI version printed out.  You should see
something similar to the following displayed (although likely with a later
version number):

```txt
fn version 0.6.1
        ______
       / ____/___
      / /_  / __ \
     / __/ / / / /
    /_/   /_/ /_/`

```

**Note:** The above Fn CLI install script requires write access to restricted folders like /usr/local/bin. If the user doesn&apos;t have write access to /usr/local/bin, or if you prefer to install Fn CLI in a different location, please see the [Fn Manual Install](#fn-manual-install) section.

## Start the Fn Server

The next install step is to start the Fn server.  Since Fn runs on
Docker it will need to be up and running too.

To start the Fn server you use the Fn CLI. Run the `fn start` command. This will
download the Fn server docker image and start the Fn Server on port 8080 by
default. Note that this process runs in the foreground so that it is easy to
stop with Ctrl-C:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```sh
> fn start
>```

If the Fn Server starts up successfully, you should see output similar to:

```txt
...
time="2019-08-07T14:55:55Z" level=info msg="ram reservations" avail_memory=1388138496
time="2019-08-07T14:55:55Z" level=info msg="available cpu" avail_cpu=4000 total_cpu=4000
time="2019-08-07T14:55:55Z" level=info msg="cpu reservations" cpu=4000
        ______
       / ____/___
      / /_  / __ \
     / __/ / / / /
    /_/   /_/ /_/

time="2019-08-07T14:55:55Z" level=info msg="Fn serving on `:8080`" type=full version=0.3.728
```

**Note:** The Fn server stores its metadata in the `~/.fn/data` directory. If you run in to errors after updating the Fn server, you may want to delete the contents of this `data` directory and restart Fn server.

If you have some other process running on port 8080, `fn start` will
fail with the following error:

```txt
docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint fnserver (d9478f85df4ef97d23d618c2318c243f1e8b65d69ca2547d889d80b148c5be09): Error starting userland proxy: Bind for 0.0.0.0:8080 failed: port is already allocated.
2018/05/10 16:49:25 error: processed finished with error exit status 125
```

In this case you can stop the other process and run `fn start` again. Alternatively,
you can start Fn server on a different port.


### Start Fn Server with DEBUG Mode Enabled
If you are troubleshooting an issue with a function, enabling the DEBUG log level can be very helpful.  To enable DEBUG log level, start the Fn server with this command.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```sh
> fn start --log-level DEBUG
>```

Now detailed information about errors will be displayed in the terminal window where you started the Fn server. 

For more information, see the [Troubleshooting and Logging Tutorial](https://github.com/fnproject/tutorials/blob/master/Troubleshooting/README.md).


### Start the Fn Server on a Different Port
Fn Server starts on port 8080 by default. To use a different port use the `--port` or the `-p` option. For example

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```sh
> fn start -p 8081
>```

When using a non-default port, you must point the Fn CLI to the new port using
the `FN_API_URL` environment variable:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```sh
> export FN_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8081
>```

Alternatively, you can also set the `api_url` using Fn [contexts](https://github.com/fnproject/cli/blob/master/CONTEXT.md).


## Test the Install
Let&apos;s verify everything is up and running correctly.

**Open a new terminal** and run the following:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```sh
> fn version
>```

You should see the version of the Fn CLI (client) and server displayed (your
version will likely differ):

```txt
Client version:  0.5.86
Server version:  0.3.728
```

**Note:**
If the server version is '?' then the Fn CLI cannot reach the Fn server. If this
happens it&apos;s likely you have something else running on port 8080 or you
started the server on a different port but forgot to set the `FN_API_URL`.

## Configure your Context

Before we start using Fn, we need to configure Fn to point to an appropriate
Docker registry so it knows where to push your function images to. Normally Fn
points to your Docker Hub account by specifying your Docker Hub username.
However, for pure local development we can simply configure Fn with an arbitrary
value such as "fndemouser".

We store the registry value in an Fn context. An Fn context represents our
current deployment environment and we can have more than one if we are deploying
to multiple servers.

### Get a List of Contexts

First, get a list of available contexts.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```sh
> fn list contexts
>```

The result should be similar to this:

```txt
CURRENT     NAME    PROVIDER    API URL                    REGISTRY
            default default     http://localhost:8080
```

Notice we have a default context which deploys to a local Fn server. The default context is created the first time you run the Fn CLI. However, we need to select default as our current context and set a registry value for remote or local Docker use.

>**Note:** Old versions of Fn used an API URL of `http://localhost:8080/v1`. This may cause 404 errors when using Fn. To update the context API URL use the command:

>```sh
>fn update context api-url http://localhost:8080
>```

### Select a Context

To select a context:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```sh
> fn use context default
>```

```txt
Now using context: default
```

The default context is now selected.

### Set Registry for Local Development
To use Fn for local development, set the registry to an arbitrary value. For example:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn update context registry fndemouser
>```

```txt
Current context updated registry with fndemouser
```

The Docker registry value is now set to "fndemouser".

### Set Registry for Normal Development
To use Fn for normal development, set the registry to your Docker Hub user name. For example:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn update context registry your-docker-hub-user-name
>```

```txt
Current context updated registry with your-docker-hub-user-name
```

The Docker registry value is now set to your-docker-hub-user-name.

### Verify Context Configuration

Now, recheck your context configuration. If you selected the local development
option you should get the following results.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn list contexts
>```

```txt
CURRENT     NAME    PROVIDER    API URL                    REGISTRY
*           default default     http://localhost:8080      fndemouser
```

The default context is now our current context and has a registry value of
`fndemouser`. You are ready to create your first function.

## Fn Manual Install
The steps to install Fn manually are described in this section. The system requirements are the same as those outlined for the script installation.

You will need to follow these steps if the user doesn&amp;t have write access to /usr/local/bin, or if you prefer to install Fn CLI in a different location.

### Download Fn CLI
Download the CLI for your operating system. For this example, files are saved to the `~/Downloads` directory.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
Open the Fn project release directory in your browser: <https://github.com/fnproject/cli/releases/>. You should see a list of executables for supported operating systems. Click on the Fn executable for your operating system and save the file locally.

| Operating System | Executable |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| MacOS | fn_mac |
| Linux | fn_linux |
| Alpine Linux | fn_alpine |
| Windows | fn.exe |

#### For Mac / Linux Systems
* Open a Terminal Window
* Change into your home directory

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```sh
> cd ~
>```

* Create a directory for your executable

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```sh
> mkdir lbin
>```

* Copy the downloaded executable file into this `lbin` directory

![user input](images/userinput.png) On Mac:
>```sh
> mv ~/Downloads/fn_mac.dms lbin/fn
>```

![user input](images/userinput.png) On Linux:
>```sh
> mv ~/Downloads/fn_linux lbin/fn
>```

* Make the file executable.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```sh
> chmod +x lbin/fn
>```

* Add the `~/lbin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable as shown below

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```sh
> export PATH=~/lbin:$PATH
>```

You can confirm using the `which fn` command, the output should look like `/Users/<your-user>/lbin/fn`. Beyond this point you can use Fn directly.

(Alternatively, you can use `~/lbin/fn` if you don't want to add to your `PATH` environment variable.)


#### For Windows Systems
The best way for Windows users is to run Fn inside a Linux virtual machine either in the cloud or using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) locally.
